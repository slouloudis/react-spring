// I've left a lot of testing stuff in here. Got into the weeds a bit, then remembered I had 15 minutes, and I'm sure you don't want to listen to me stumble around trying to explain some of the things I encountered! I've left them in if you want to have a look, but the useChainHook is mega broken atm :)
